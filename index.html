                <p>During this war the two sides were the Persians who wanted to rule Greece after Athens helped one of their cites and the Delian League led by Athens who just wanted to survive.
                    This war started when Ilos was helped by Athens to get away from the Persian Empire but then caused them to come after all of Greece so the Polis banded together to fend them away.
